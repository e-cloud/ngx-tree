DEMO\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n\nClaims\nThis module derivates from angular-tree-component. We remove the mobx dependency and do some performance improvements, whilst keep a similar component interface.\nInstallation\nTo install this library, run:\n$ npm install @e-cloud/ngx-tree --saveUsage\nFor details, please take a look at document site\nImports\nOnce you have installed the library, you can import it in your Angular AppModule:\nimport { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';\nimport { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\n\nimport { AppComponent } from './app.component';\n\n// Import your library\nimport { NgxTreeModule } from '@e-cloud/ngx-tree';\n\n@NgModule({\n  declarations: [\n    AppComponent\n  ],\n  imports: [\n    BrowserModule,\n\n    // Specify your library as an import\n    NgxTreeModule.forRoot()\n  ],\n  providers: [],\n  bootstrap: [AppComponent]\n})\nexport class AppModule { }Applications\ndemo usage\n\n\n  {{title}}\n\n\n  \n    {{ node.data.name }}\n  \n\nNOTE: the minimum input for ngx-tree component is nodes.\n\nRoot config\nThere is a forRoot() method on NgxTreeModule, which should be used only on root module of apps.\nforRoot injects two providers, TreeDraggingTargetService and VIRTUAL_SCROLL_NODE_HEIGHT_QUOTA. The first holds the dragging element. The other specify the round size to calculate the average tree item height.\nTree options\nWe split the tree options into two category, TreeDataOptions and TreeUIOptions. dataOptions inputted by user will be passed into TreeModel which handle the tree data operations. uiOption will be passed into every child components required and declared tree templates(will introduce late).\nTree templates\nWe predefine five tree templates for flexible customization.\n\nloadingTemplate - loading indicator for async nodes\nexpanderTemplate - for tree expander customization,\ntreeNodeTemplate - for customization of tree node contents(not including node children components and node expander, only for every single node's content)\ntreeNodeWrapperTemplate - treeNodeTemplate + full customization over expander\ntreeNodeFullTemplate - treeNodeWrapperTemplate + full customization over how the node children display.\n\nDevelopment\nTo generate all *.js, *.d.ts and *.metadata.json files:\n$ npm run buildTo lint all *.ts files:\n$ npm run lintLicense\nMIT © e-cloud\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n
